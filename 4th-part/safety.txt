saftey describes how your system behaves in case of an fault leading to an error

gracefull degradation
	if in your car the ABS is in error
		it should respond with a message
		instead of f.ex. hitting the brakes with full force

SA_Aircraftmonitor behaves
	
	on loss of connection
		Software keeps running
		no warning
	
	on loss of redis
		exception is thrown
		keeps running
			webserver.class 
			browser
		functionality
			map stays shown
			airplanes vanish
	
	on missing mapbasic
		SA_Aricraftmonitor does not realize missing map data
		Browser
			no data received
	
	on loss of mapbasic
		keeps running
		no error
			browser did make a local copy of mapbasic
		on browser-restart
			no data received
			the mapbasic-file could not be loaded
	

next steps
	is the behavior of SA_Aircraftmonitor acceptable as viewed from a user?
	should a message be shown in any of the tested cases?
	how should any message be presented?
	how would a user otherwise notice that something is wrong?
